# sorting_functions

## Description
The aim of this project was to implement three types of sorting functions - merge sort, quick sort and introspective sort - and to test their computational complexity. I had to implement bash scripts which would generate arrays with different sizes (e.g. 1 000, 5 000, 10 000, 50 000, 100 000, 500 000 and 1 000 000 elements), make different variations of arrays' basic states (not sorted, sorted in 25%, sorted in 50% etc.) and then run the three programs. 

## Running the code
To run the program after cloning the repository to your computer you have to compile proper files (depending on which sort type you want to use). The input of each sort is the size of an array you want to sort and the elements of it.

## Documentation
More detailed description of the results of tests and the algorithm is in _PAMSI_projekt_1.pdf_ file. It is written in Polish as it is an assignment for a course at my university.
