# sorting_functions

## Description
The aim of this project was to implement three types of sorting functions - merge sort, quick sort and introspective sort - and to test their computational complexity. I had to implement bash scripts which would generate arrays with different sizes (e.g. 1 000, 5 000, 10 000, 50 000, 100 000, 500 000 and 1 000 000 elements), make different variations of arrays' basic states (not sorted, sorted in 25%, sorted in 50% etc.) and then run the three programs.
